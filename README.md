# AetherShell

**The first ever bridge between the Nintendo DSi and Augmented Reality.**

AetherShell is an open-source platform that brings your Nintendo DSi sketches to life over the internet. 
By connecting 20-year-old handheld hardware to a modern app, your drawings are interpreted, animated, made to dance & projected into your physical space using AR.
